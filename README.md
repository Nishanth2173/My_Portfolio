Portfolio 

I had created my portfolio using React, Tailwind css, Bootstrap, HTML

first we need to collect all the sources that we needed.

For favicon go for this site -https://favicon.io/

then go for official documents of Bootstrap and Tailwind css

then we need to create project using 
npm create vite@latest
and select react, javascript after that we need to insatll node modules

npm i

and then we need to install react-router-dom for routing and navigation purpose.
after that run the project

npm run dev
